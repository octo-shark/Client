Time Tracking in No Time - Tear, Shred & Bite through Wasted Time

Time Shark makes time tracking effortless. Time Shark is a hardware and software solution that allows you to track your time instantly, enjoyably, and more effectively. Time Shark runs on all platforms.

TimeShark is an IoT device and app designed to assist users in managing their time while at work and on the go. You can securely log in, change personal preferences, and review historical data. Designed with Service Oriented Architecture for scalability. Track time with the flip of the pylon.

How Time Shark Works
	Define 	- Set up what you want to track and customize the pylon & software.
	Track 		- Connect pylon via Bluetooth and Time Shark tracks the project that is face up.
	Analyze 	- Use our useful statistics and charts to get insights into how you use your time.

How exactly can I use the Time Shark in my daily routine? Turn the Time Shark pylon face up to which task you want track. Then you get a phone call and turn it to the "phone" side facing up. When the call is over, simply turn the Time Shark pylon to the task you were previously doing.
